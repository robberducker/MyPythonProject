# Number Guessing Game

A simple text-based number guessing game built in Python.

## Description

This is a Python project where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game will provide feedback whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. It keeps track of the number of attempts it takes to guess the number correctly.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User input validation to ensure that only valid numbers are entered.
- Feedback to the user after every guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- Tracks the number of attempts made to guess the correct number.
